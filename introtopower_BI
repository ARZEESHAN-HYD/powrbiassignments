Descriptive analytics is typically the starting point in business intelligence. It uses data aggregation and data mining to collect and organize historical data, producing 
visualizations such as line graphs, bar charts, pie charts. Descriptive analytics presents a clear picture of what has happened in the past, such as statistical modeling does, 
and it stops there — it doesn’t make interpretations or advise on future actions.

Explain Predictive analytics?
When you know what happened in the past and understand why it happened, you can then begin to predict what is likely to occur in the future based on that information.
 Predictive analytics takes the investigation a step further, using statistics, computational modeling, and machine learning to determine the probability of various outcomes.
